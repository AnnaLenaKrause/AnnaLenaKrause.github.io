    "text": "Hi, I’m Anna, a master’s student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University. In the past, I have completed bachelor’s in Data Science & AI and Psychology. My interests lie in the fields of mental health, neuroscience and women’s brain health.\nDuring my academic journey, I have developed a passion for applying machine learning techniques to the mental health and neuroscience domains. Currently I am following this interest during an internship at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I investigate the impact of the sex hormones estradiol and progesterone on brain connectivity during the menstrual cycle. Bonus: The amazing view from the lab, which you can see on the top of this page!\nIn my free time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, water colouring, lino cuts."
